Developed a Python-based firewall solution using Scapy to proactively detect and mitigate
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The system analyzes network traffic in real time, effectively identifying and
blocking malicious IP addresses. Key features include signature-based threat detection, flexible IP management,
and comprehensive logging and alerting capabilities. This project demonstrates expertise in network security and
Python programming, showcasing the ability to design and implement scalable cybersecurity solutions that improve
organizational resilience.

more ways to enhance:
1. Alerting: Nortify email.txt, API Integration
2. wEB BASED DASHBOARDS: visualize data in real-time, graphs[no of packets/sec,no of ips,detected malware signatures,packet rates,etc],
   adv-geodata
   frameworks: flask/django or javascript: chart.js/d3.js
   application: web dev,appsec,bug bounty
4. IMprove signature detection: OWASP:[sqli,xss,etc]
   relationship btw signature and functions
   network threat mastery
